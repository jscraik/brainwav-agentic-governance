# brAInwav Agentic Governance

This repository contains the governance framework, policies, and operational procedures extracted from the Cortex-OS project for use in agentic systems development.

## Purpose

This repository serves as a standalone governance pack that can be:
- Referenced by other projects
- Used to establish consistent development standards
- Applied to agent-driven development workflows
- Integrated into various development environments

## Key Documents

### Core Governance
- **AGENTS.md** - Main operational instructions for all agents (human and AI)
- **CODESTYLE.md** - Mandatory coding standards and style guides
- **AGENTS-GOVERNANCE.md** - Governance-specific agent instructions
- **CONTRIBUTING.md** - Contribution guidelines and processes
- **CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md** - Community standards and behavior expectations
- **SECURITY.md** - Security policies and vulnerability reporting

### Governance Framework
- **.cortex/** - Complete governance rule system including:
  - Rules and policies
  - Templates and schemas
  - Workflow definitions
  - Charter documents
- **governance/** - Additional governance documents and procedures
- **governance-pack/** - Packaged governance materials

## Usage

These governance documents are designed to be:
1. **Authoritative** - CI enforces key rules defined herein
2. **Hierarchical** - Clear chain of authority and precedence
3. **Adaptable** - Can be extended for specific project needs
4. **Enforceable** - Machine-readable policies with automated checks

## Integration

To use this governance framework in your project:

1. Reference the governance rules in your CI/CD pipelines
2. Implement the coding standards and style guides
3. Follow the agent operational procedures
4. Use the templates for consistent documentation
5. Apply the security and contribution policies

## Maintenance

This governance framework is maintained separately from the main Cortex-OS project to ensure:
- Clean separation of concerns
- Reusability across projects
- Version stability for governance policies
- Independent evolution of governance practices

## Original Context

These governance documents were extracted from [Cortex-OS](https://github.com/jamiescottcraik/Cortex-OS), a comprehensive AI development platform. They represent battle-tested practices for:
- Agent-driven development
- AI safety and governance
- Quality assurance and testing
- Security and compliance
- Repository management and CI/CD
