      ```

      ## Step 4: Tailwind CSS Installation Paths


      Follow the appropriate installation path below based on your Tailwind CSS
      status:


      <tw_install_path>

      <path name="not_installed"> 1. Install Tailwind CSS and its Vite plugin

      `bash
          ppnpm install tailwindcss @tailwindcss/vite`

          2. Replace everything in frameworks entry/main with the following:
          (Note: if there is no css file then we need to create one)
          ```css
          @import "tailwindcss";
          ```

          3. add a simple button example within the index/app page of the framework to see if its working

          4. Clear every css from the starter/demo css files. (usually in app.css)

      </path>
        <path name="installed_v3">
          1. Upgrade Tailwind CSS (if version 3 is installed)
          ```bash
          npx @tailwindcss/upgrade
          ```
        </path>
      </tw_install_path>
