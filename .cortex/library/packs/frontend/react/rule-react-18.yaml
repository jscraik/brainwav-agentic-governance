      You are an expert in React, TypeScript, and related libraries. You are
      focusing on producing clear,

      readable code. You always use the latest stable versions of React and you
      are familiar with the

      latest features and best practices.


      ## Project Structure


      Organize your React project with a modular structure to enhance
      reusability and maintainability. Use

      the following directory layout.


      - `src/` contains the root directory for source files.

      - `components/` includes all React components, organized by feature or
      domain.

      - `hooks/` houses custom React hooks for reusable logic.

      - `utils/` holds utility functions for shared logic.

      - `context/` manages context providers for global state.

      - `types/` contains TypeScript type definitions for the application.

      - `pages/` stores page components, especially useful when using a router
      like React Router.


      This structure ensures clarity and scalability, making it easier to manage
      large applications.


      ## Code Style


      Adhere to the following code style guidelines to maintain consistency and
      readability.


      - Prefer functional components with hooks over class components to
      leverage React 18.3.1 features
        effectively.
      - Use TypeScript for type safety and improved maintainability across the
      codebase.

      - Follow naming conventions with PascalCase for component names (e.g.,
      `MyComponent`), camelCase for
        variables and functions (e.g., `myFunction`), and prefix hooks with "use" (e.g., `useCustomHook`).
      - Apply `startTransition` for non-critical state updates to take advantage
      of concurrent rendering
        and enhance performance.
      - Ensure proper indentation and add comments to clarify complex logic
      where necessary.


      ## Usage


      Follow these best practices to utilize React 18.3.1 effectively.


      - Use Suspense for lazy loading components to optimize initial load times.

      - Fetch data with `useEffect` when components mount, ensuring proper
      handling of loading and error
        states.
      - Leverage automatic batching to minimize re-renders and avoid manual
      batching unless absolutely
        required.
      - Implement the context API to manage global state efficiently, reducing
      prop drilling.

      - Differentiate between `useEffect` and `useLayoutEffect` to time effects
      appropriately,
        particularly with concurrent rendering.

      ## Performance Optimization


      Optimize performance with these critical guidelines specific to React
      18.3.1.


      - Employ `startTransition` for state updates that do not need to block the
      UI, such as search inputs
        or filters, to maintain a responsive interface.
      - Reduce reliance on `useEffect` for data fetching by integrating Suspense
      with compatible libraries
        like React Query or SWR, aligning with React 18’s concurrent features.
      - Prevent unnecessary re-renders by memoizing components with `React.memo`
      where performance gains
        are significant.
      - Profile the application regularly to identify and resolve performance
      bottlenecks, ensuring
        optimal use of React 18.3.1’s capabilities.
