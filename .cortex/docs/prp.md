## 1. Objective

**Problem:** Ensure legacy MVP flows are powered by the PRP gate runner

**Outcome (Measurable):** Maintain PRPState schema compatibility

**Requirements:**
- Maintain PRPState schema compatibility
- Expose teaching artifacts for adaptive behavior
- Keep MVP server + MCP consumers working without change

---

## 2. Scope & Non-Goals

**In Scope:**
- To be defined based on requirements

**Non-Goals:**
- To be defined during specification phase

---

## 3. Constraints (from initial.md)

**Coverage Requirements:**
- Lines: ≥ 95%
- Branches: ≥ 90%

**Performance Budgets:**
- LCP: ≤ 2500ms
- TBT: ≤ 300ms

**Accessibility:**
- WCAG 2.2 AA compliance
- Score: ≥ 95%

**Security:**
- No red findings
- SBOM + signed artifacts (Sigstore)

**Architecture:**
- Package boundaries: Standard boundaries
- No cross-boundary imports without adapter

---

## 4. Design Summary

- Design summary to be captured during G1 Specification gate

**Architecture Diagrams:** To be provided in design phase
**Sequence Flows:** To be documented in /docs/

---

## 5. Chain I/O Handoffs

Chain I/O persona deliverables will populate after the run manifest is generated.

---

## 6. Interfaces & Contracts

**API Specifications:** To be defined during specification phase
**Type Definitions:** To be generated during implementation
**Error Models:** Following problem+json standard

---

## 7. Test Plan

- Unit tests for core logic
- Integration tests for API endpoints
- End-to-end tests for user workflows

**Test Categories:**
- Unit: Core business logic
- Integration: API and service interactions
- A11y: Keyboard navigation and screen reader compatibility
- Security: Input validation and authorization checks

---
