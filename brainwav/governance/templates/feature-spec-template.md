## Executive Summary

[2-3 sentence overview of what this feature accomplishes and why it matters for brAInwav governance framework]

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

<!--
CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:
1. User stories MUST be PRIORITIZED by importance (P0 > P1 > P2 > P3)
2. Each story MUST be INDEPENDENTLY TESTABLE
3. Implementing just ONE story should deliver viable value (MVP principle)
4. Each story should have clear acceptance criteria in Given-When-Then format

Priority Definitions:
- P0 (Critical): Blocking issues, security vulnerabilities, data loss prevention
- P1 (High): Core functionality required for MVP, primary user journeys
- P2 (Medium): Important enhancements, secondary features, quality improvements
- P3 (Low): Nice-to-haves, future optimizations, aesthetic improvements
-->

### User Story 1: [Brief Descriptive Title] (Priority: P1)

**As a** [user type],  
**I want to** [action/capability],  
**So that** [business value/outcome].

**Why This Priority**: [Explain why this is P1 - what makes it core to the MVP?]

**Independent Test Criteria**: 
[Describe how this can be tested independently - e.g., "Can be fully tested by performing X action and verifying Y outcome, which delivers standalone value of Z to users"]

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** [initial system state or preconditions]  
   **When** [user performs specific action]  
   **Then** [expected system response with measurable outcome]  
   **And** [any additional expected outcomes]

2. **Given** [different initial state]  
   **When** [alternative user action]  
   **Then** [expected alternative outcome]

**brAInwav Branding Requirements**:
- [List any UI messages, logs, or outputs that must include brAInwav branding]

### User Story 2: [Brief Descriptive Title] (Priority: P2)

**As a** [user type],  
**I want to** [action/capability],  
**So that** [business value/outcome].

**Why This Priority**: [Explain why this is P2 - what makes it important but not critical?]

**Independent Test Criteria**: 
[Describe standalone testing approach]

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** [initial state]  
   **When** [action]  
   **Then** [expected outcome]

**Dependencies**: 
- [List any dependencies on other stories, if applicable]

### User Story 3: [Brief Descriptive Title] (Priority: P3)

**As a** [user type],  
**I want to** [action/capability],  
**So that** [business value/outcome].

**Why This Priority**: [Explain why this is P3 - nice to have but not essential]

**Independent Test Criteria**: 
[Describe standalone testing approach]

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** [initial state]  
   **When** [action]  
   **Then** [expected outcome]

---

### Edge Cases & Error Scenarios

<!--
Think about boundary conditions, error states, and exceptional circumstances.
Each edge case should have its own Given-When-Then scenario.
-->

#### Edge Case 1: [Description]
**Given** [boundary condition or unusual state]  
**When** [action that triggers edge case]  
**Then** [expected graceful handling]  
**And** [error message includes brAInwav branding]

#### Edge Case 2: [Description]
**Given** [error condition]  
**When** [triggering action]  
**Then** [system handles gracefully]  
**And** [appropriate logging/telemetry emitted]

## Technical Constraints

### Must Use
- Named exports only (no `export default`)
- Async/await exclusively (no `.then()` chains)
- Functions ≤ 40 lines (split if longer)
- Zod schemas for input validation
- brAInwav branding in all outputs

### Must Avoid
- `Math.random()` for production data
- Mock/placeholder responses in production paths
- TODO comments in production code
- Direct cross-domain imports (use A2A events)
- Secrets in code (use environment variables)

### Integration Points
- **MCP Tools**: [List any MCP tools this feature uses/provides]
- **A2A Events**: [List events this feature emits/consumes]
- **Databases**: [List database interactions]
- **External APIs**: [List external service dependencies]

// Example MCP Tool
export const featureToolSchema = z.object({
  input: z.object({
    query: z.string(),
    options: z.object({
      limit: z.number().max(100),
    }),
  }),
});
```
