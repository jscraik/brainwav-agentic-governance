# MCP Implementation Plan (Archived)

This file previously captured a Cortex-OS implementation plan. It is now archived to reduce duplication and branding noise.

- For current MCP architecture guidance, see `brainwav/governance/context/protocols/model-context-protocol.md`.
- For operational workflows, see `brainwav/governance/10-flow/agentic-coding-workflow.md`.
- For Assurance/Oversight, see `brainwav/governance/10-flow/assurance-system.md`.

Refer to git history if you need the original plan details.
