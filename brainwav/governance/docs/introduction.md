# Introduction

The brAInwav Agentic Governance Framework provides a portable, project-neutral set of policies, workflows, templates, and automation for governing human + AI collaboration. It is designed to be copied into any repository to inherit structured development practices.

## Core Problems Addressed

- **Consistent Development Workflow** – ArcTDD gates (G0–G10) with Phase Machine (R→G→F→REVIEW).
- **Evidence-Based Delivery** – Mandatory Evidence Triplet (milestone test, contract snapshot, reviewer disposition).
- **Oversight & Compliance** – Cortex Aegis MCP for vibe checks, academic research, license validation.
- **Security Standards** – OWASP Top 10 2025, ASVS 5.0.0, LLM Top 10, SBOM/attestation requirements.

## What This Framework Is

- A **governance pack** – policies, checklists, templates, and runbooks.
- **Project-neutral** – copy it into any repository; no runtime dependencies.
- **Human + AI** – rules apply equally to human developers and AI agents.

## What This Framework Is NOT

- A runtime or application – there's no `pnpm dev` server.
- A package library – no npm packages to install (except optional Cortex Aegis MCP).
- A replacement for your project's code – it governs how work is done, not what is built.
