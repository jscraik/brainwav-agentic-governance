## Security Requirements

- **Secrets:** Fetch on-demand via 1Password CLI `op`; no hard-coded secrets.
- **Containers:** Minimal base, pinned digests, non-root, read-only FS, drop caps.
- **Identity:** CI/services authenticate via OIDC/WIF (no static cloud keys).
- **SBOM:** CycloneDX 1.7 or SPDX 3.0.1 with SLSA provenance and Sigstore signing.
