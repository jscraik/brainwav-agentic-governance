## 1. How to Use This File

- **Humans** use this file before committing, opening PRs, or approving reviews. Reference section numbers in PR templates and review notes.
- **Agents** load this file at session start, select the relevant flow (Feature/Research/Fix/Refactor/Review), and follow the gate checklist for the current ArcTDD stage.
- **CI** jobs reference section numbers via `CHECKLIST_SECTION` annotations (e.g. `CI:G5`), and upload artefacts named after these sections.

## 2. Local Dev & Agent Run Checklist

> Run before you commit or ask an agent to change files.

### 2.1 General Local Sanity

- [ ] Dependencies install cleanly: `pnpm install` (or `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile`).
- [ ] Lint passes for affected projects: `pnpm nx affected -t lint` (fallback `pnpm lint`).
- [ ] Typecheck passes: `pnpm nx affected -t typecheck` (fallback `pnpm typecheck`).
- [ ] Build/dev target succeeds for touched surface: `pnpm nx affected -t build` or the package-specific `pnpm --filter <pkg> build`.

### 2.2 Agent Session Startup

- [ ] Agent read `.cortex/rules/10-flow/governance-quickstart.md` and `10-flow/agentic-coding-workflow.md` this session.
- [ ] Task type + flow selected; task folder located; current gate (G0–G10) identified in `run-manifest.json`.
- [ ] Agent configured for:
  - [ ] Patch-first diffs (no whole-file rewrites).
  - [ ] Structured outputs / JSON schemas where required.
  - [ ] JEDI rules (named exports, ≤40-line functions, no TODO/FIXME/HACK, cancellation support for HTTP/tool calls).

### 2.3 Local Quality Checks (Developer)

- [ ] Every new/changed code path has at least one automated test.
- [ ] Breaking contracts (API/event/schema) documented in `context/requirements.md` and target docs/ADR.
- [ ] Feature flags/config defaults are safe/off by default and described in `ops/rollout-plan.md`.
- [ ] Secrets pulled via `op` (1Password CLI); no secrets committed or persisted.

---

## 3. PR Author Checklist

> Complete before opening or updating a PR. Attach evidence links where possible.

### 3.1 Metadata & Scope

- [ ] PR description links to `tasks/<task-slug>/` (or `Changelog/<slug>/`).
- [ ] PR states task type + flow and highest gate completed (e.g. "Feature flow through G6").
- [ ] `run-manifest.json` committed/updated with tier, gates, Evidence Triplet pointers, and `reuseEvidence` entries.

### 3.2 Evidence Triplet

- [ ] **Tests**: cite failing test path/log pre-change and passing evidence post-change (`evidence/tests.md`, `evidence/test-results/*`).
- [ ] **Plan**: `plan/PLAN.md` (≤7 steps) matches implemented work; include link/anchor.
- [ ] **Review**: Reviewer neuron scheduled; human reviewer requested; `evidence/review.json` & `review-notes.md` placeholders present.

### 3.3 Artefact Presence by Flow

- [ ] `meta/task.json`, `context/requirements.md` (North-Star), `context/research.md`, `plan/PLAN.md`, `plan/tdd-plan.md`, `work/implementation-log.md`.
- [ ] `evidence/aegis-report.json` uploaded (Cortex-Aegis G2/G5 verdicts) + `logs/vibe-check/*.json`.
- [ ] `implementation-plan.md#reuse-ledger` updated; `run-manifest.json.reuseEvidence.*` filled.

#### Research / Spike

- [ ] `meta/task.json` type=Research; `context/research.md` with queries + citations; license checks logged in `research/connectors-health.log`.

- [ ] `evidence/aegis-report.json` (risk ≥ medium) and connectors health log updated.

#### Refactor

- [ ] Baseline invariants + perf metrics captured in `context/research.md`.
- [ ] `plan/PLAN.md` clarifies boundaries + success metrics (no behaviour change).
- [ ] `evidence/tests.md` shows before/after parity (tests, perf, mutation).

#### Review-only

- [ ] `meta/task.json` type=Review; `evidence/review.json` + `review-notes.md` populated; checklist pasted as PR comment.

### 3.4 Documentation & Ops

- [ ] READMEs/API docs/runbooks updated (cite files/links).
- [ ] `ops/rollout-plan.md` + `ops/rollback-plan.md` committed when rollout/flags apply.
- [ ] Changelog entry created (`pnpm changelog:new --slug <slug> --tier <type>` or successor tooling) and referenced in PR.

## 4. Code Review Checklist (Human + AI)

> Applies at G6; AI reviewer consumes this list, human reviewer references the same items.

### 4.1 Governance & Scope

- [ ] Scope appropriate; no unrelated changes.
- [ ] Constitution + AGENT_CHARTER requirements satisfied (branding, secrets, reality filter, no fake telemetry).
- [ ] Task folder + `run-manifest.json` present and current.
- [ ] Reuse-first artefacts (analysis/reuse-evaluation.md + PLAN reuse ledger) reviewed; helper diffs cite evidence.

### 4.2 Correctness & Tests

- [ ] Tests cover new behaviour, edge cases, and failure modes; regression tests prove fixes.
- [ ] Evidence Triplet verified (failing→passing tests, plan anchor, reviewer proof).
- [ ] Coverage ≥90% global / 95% changed lines; mutation ≥90% where enabled.

### 4.3 Accessibility & UX

- [ ] UI/CLI changes meet WCAG 2.2 AA (axe/jest-axe evidence) and support keyboard-only + screen readers.
- [ ] No color-only signalling; focus order + labels verified; mention "no UI impact" if not applicable.

### 4.4 Security & Privacy

- [ ] No secrets or keys committed; 1Password CLI usage documented.
- [ ] New inputs validated; outputs encoded; threat model touched if risk tags include security/privacy.
- [ ] Semgrep, gitleaks, OSV, `pnpm security:scan`, SBOM (CycloneDX 1.7), and SLSA v1.1 attestations referenced.

### 4.5 Performance & Reliability

- [ ] Hot path changes reviewed for allocations + complexity; long-running operations cancellable.
- [ ] Observability: logs/metrics/traces include `brand:"brAInwav"`, `trace_id`, `traceparent`.
- [ ] Rollback plan realistic; feature flags guard risky features.

### 4.6 AI / MCP Specific

- [ ] Live model usage only; `logs/models/*` show health/smoke runs with IDs + latency.
- [ ] Prompt/schema changes versioned + tested; MCP connectors documented + healthy.
- [ ] Reviewer notes include disposition for each AI finding (Accept/Reject/Follow-up) in `evidence/review-notes.md`.

- [ ] Any task introducing a new MCP tool, connector, or ML model integration.

### 7.2 Inputs Required

- [ ] `plan/PLAN.md` (≤7 steps) + `plan/tdd-plan.md` summarised in the Aegis request (`steps` field, ≤7 items).
- [ ] `context/research.md` citations + connector health log references.
