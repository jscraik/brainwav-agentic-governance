# brAInwav Agentic Governance Framework

> **Neutral, portable governance for AI-assisted delivery teams**

[![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-Apache%202.0-blue.svg)](LICENSE)

The brAInwav framework packages policies, workflows, templates, and automation for governing human + AI collaboration. It is intentionally project-neutral: copy it into any repository to inherit ArcTDD gates, Cortex-Aegis oversight, reuse-first delivery checks, and SHA-pinned policy validation.

---

## Why Teams Adopt This Framework

- **ArcTDD + Phase Machine** – Standardized G0–G10 workflow (R→G→F→REVIEW) with ≤7-step plans, failing-first tests, and evidence capture at every gate.
- **Evidence Triplet & Run Manifests** – Mandatory pointers to (1) milestone test red→green proof, (2) contract snapshot, (3) reviewer disposition JSON.
- **Cortex-Aegis Oversight** – Live MCP/CLI gate that enforces academic research, license validation, and vibe checks before any side-effecting work.
- **Security & Compliance** – OWASP Top 10:2025, OWASP ASVS 5.0.0, OWASP LLM Top 10 (2025), NIST SSDF 1.1, NIST AI RMF + GenAI Profile, WCAG 2.2, SLSA v1.2, CycloneDX 1.7, SPDX 3.0.1, Sigstore Cosign, and OpenSSF Scorecard alignment (see `SECURITY.md`).
- **Governance Integrity** – `brainwav/governance/90-infra/governance-index.json` pins SHA-256 hashes for every normative doc; CI blocks mismatches.
- **MCP-First Tooling** – RepoPrompt, Context7, Local Memory, and Cortex-Aegis MCP servers with run-manifest logging, plus Local Memory parity rules.
- **Modular Control Framework** – Core + capability packs + GitHub Actions adapters, with controls-as-data for auditability and external defensibility.

---

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 24.11.x + pnpm 10.19.x (pinned in `.mise.toml`).
- Security toolchain installed locally and in CI: `semgrep`, `gitleaks`, `trivy`, `cosign`, `cyclonedx`, plus OSV/pnpm audit support (`pnpm audit`, `osv-scanner`).
- MCP clients (VS Code, Claude Desktop, RepoPrompt CLI) with access to Context7, Local Memory, and Cortex-Aegis servers.

### Bootstrap Steps (pack maintainers)

```bash
# 1. Clone the framework
git clone https://github.com/jscraik/brainwav-agentic-governance.git

# 2. Install dependencies + security tools
pnpm install
pnpm ensure:tools        # installs repo-required CLIs (Semgrep, Gitleaks, etc.)

# 3. Run governance bootstrap (discover hashes, MCP config, governance index)
pnpm cortex:governance-bootstrap

# 4. (Optional) Validate MCP health + oversight
pnpm oversight:vibe-check --goal "<task>" --plan "<≤7 steps>" --session "demo"

# 5. Verify required tooling and governance files
pnpm readiness:check
```

### Install & Verify in a consumer project

> Use this when you want to drop governance into an existing repo.

1. From this repo: `pnpm install` (Node 24.11.x, pnpm 10.19.x).  
2. Install governance into the target repo:  
   `pnpm governance:install --dest /path/to/consumer-repo [--mode full|pointer] [--profile core|creative|full]`  
   - `full` copies AGENTS, CODESTYLE, SECURITY, `brainwav/governance/**`, issue/PR templates, and the GitHub Actions workflow.  
   - `pointer` writes pointer stubs + `.agentic-governance/pointer.json` and expects a lockfile-pinned `brainwav-agentic-governance` dependency (invoke scripts from `node_modules/brainwav-agentic-governance/scripts` or via `pnpm dlx`).
3. In the consumer repo, run:  
   `pnpm governance:validate` (checks required tokens + Step Budget ≤7)  
   `pnpm governance:sync-hashes:check` (ensures hashes match the index)
4. Commit the added files and ensure the consumer CI uses Node 24.11.x + pnpm 10.19.x. The included `governance.yml` workflow will enforce readiness, hash drift, oversight, security scans, dependency boundaries, and task scaffolds on every PR.

### Automation scripts (wired)

- `pnpm ensure:tools` — checks required CLIs (rg, fd, jq, semgrep, gitleaks, trivy, cosign, osv-scanner, markdownlint-cli2) and engine versions.
- `pnpm cortex:governance-bootstrap` — writes `.agentic-governance/agent-context.json` with AGENTS.md hash and workflow pointers.
- `pnpm oversight:vibe-check --goal "..." --plan "..." [--session <id>] [--slug <task>]` — posts to the Cortex Aegis HTTP endpoint (default `http://127.0.0.1:2091/vibe_check`) and logs JSON under the task.
- `pnpm readiness:check` — confirms core governance files exist and required tools are present.
- `pnpm governance:install --dest <path>` — copy governance pack + CI workflow into another repo.
- `pnpm governance:validate` — verify required tokens and Step Budget ≤7 across tasks.
- `pnpm governance:sync-hashes:check` — fail on governance hash drift (non-writing).
- `pnpm task:scaffold --slug <id>` / `pnpm task:validate --slug <id>` — create and check task folders for Evidence Triplet placeholders.
- `pnpm governance:check-nx` — run Nx graph when nx.json exists (skips if absent); included in CI template.
- `pnpm governance:validate-evidence` — verify Evidence Triplet files, memory IDs, trace context, and academic research logs are present and non-empty.

Customize `AGENTS.md`, `brainwav/governance/00-core/constitution.md`, and templates under `brainwav/governance/templates/` with your maintainers, escalation paths, and brand wording. Update `.agentic-governance/mcp.runtime.json` in consumer repos if you add or relocate MCP transports.

### Documentation quality checklist (OpenAI Cookbook aligned)
- State prerequisites up front (here: Node 24.11.x, pnpm 10.19.x, security toolchain).
- Provide a minimal happy path (see “Install & Verify in a consumer project”).
- Include verification commands (`governance:validate`, `governance:sync-hashes:check`) so readers can confirm success.
- Keep steps copy/pasteable and ordered; mark optional steps clearly.
- Link enforcement to CI templates so readers know what’s automated vs manual.

## Architecture: Core + Packs + Adapters

**Core (mandatory):** AGENTS.md, step budget, evidence triplet, hash-pinned governance index, creative/delivery modes, and AI risk controls by default.  
**Capability packs (opt-in):** security-appsec, supply-chain, a11y, ai-risk, compliance-overlays.  
**Adapters:** GitHub Actions templates and stack-specific command mappings (policy text stays identical).

Controls are stored as data in `brainwav/governance/90-infra/control-registry.core.yaml` and mapped to public standards for auditability.

---

## Creative vs Delivery Modes

**Creative mode (default for ideation/spikes):** No side-effecting actions, no deploys, no secrets; output is a short artifact + next steps.  
**Delivery mode (required for merge/release):** All ArcTDD gates, evidence triplets, oversight, and security/a11y/supply-chain checks apply. CI enforces Delivery regardless of local mode.

---

## Adoption Paths (Dec 2025 best practice)

1) **Fast path (no Docker):** minimal local checks, full CI gates.  
2) **Containerized tooling:** single tools image for scanners and SBOM/provenance.  
3) **Full local install:** all scanners and governance tools installed locally.

## Governance Commands

The framework ships executable commands under `brainwav/governance/commands/`. Run them with Node.js:

```bash
# Recall context from Local Memory MCP
TASK_SLUG=my-task node brainwav/governance/commands/recall.mjs "governance workflow" --limit=5

# Store task context to memory
TASK_SLUG=my-task node brainwav/governance/commands/memorize.mjs

# Generate daily standup summary
TASK_SLUG=my-task DAILY_FOCUS="observability" node brainwav/governance/commands/daily-summary.mjs

# Prepare incident post-mortem
INCIDENT_ID=INC-742 node brainwav/governance/commands/incident-review.mjs
```

| Command | Markdown Spec | Executable | Purpose |
|---------|---------------|------------|---------|
| `/memorize` | `memorize.md` | `memorize.mjs` | Store governance context to Local Memory |
| `/recall` | `recall.md` | `recall.mjs` | Retrieve context via semantic search |
| `/daily-summary` | `daily-summary.md` | `daily-summary.mjs` | Generate standup summary with git status |
| `/incident-review` | `incident-review.md` | `incident-review.mjs` | Prepare structured post-incident review |
| `/gather` | `gather.md` | — | LLM prompt for context collection |
| `/reframe` | `reframe.md` | — | LLM prompt for plan validation |
| `/truth` | `truth.md` | — | LLM prompt for factual audits |
| `/sprint-goals` | `sprint-goals.md` | — | LLM prompt for sprint planning |

## Operational Pillars

### Hierarchy of Authority

1. **Governance Pack** – `brainwav/governance/**/*` (Constitution, Charter, workflows, checklists).
2. **CODESTYLE.md** – Enforced coding and architectural rules.
3. **Root `AGENTS.md`** – Repository-wide agent instructions.
4. **Nearest package `AGENTS.md`** – May tighten rules, never weaken.

### ArcTDD + Phase Machine

- ArcTDD gates G0–G10 map to the R→G→F→REVIEW pipeline.
- Plans MUST be ≤7 steps per arc, with Ask-First clarifications ≤3 per session.
- Every task maintains `tasks/<slug>/json/run-manifest.json` with gate status, evidence pointers, and MCP session logs.

### Task & Evidence Contract

Each task produces a governed folder:

```
tasks/<slug>/
├── context/ (research, connector health, requirements)
├── plan/ (PLAN.md, risk register, tdd-plan)
├── work/implementation-log.md
├── evidence/ (tests.md, critic-review.json, confession-report.json, aegis-report.json)
├── logs/vibe-check/*.json
├── logs/academic-research/*.json
├── json/run-manifest.json + memory-ids.json
└── SUMMARY.md + session-retrospective
```

### Oversight & Academic Research

- Cortex-Aegis MCP server (`@brainwav/cortex-aegis-mcp`, default port 2091) runs `vibe_check`, `connector_health`, `license_validate`, and `time_freshness` tools.
- Agents must run research via Wikidata MCP (3029), arXiv MCP (3041), Semantic Scholar/OpenAlex APIs, and Context7 before calling Aegis.
- Oversight gates: G2 (always) and G5 (when risk ≥ medium). Responses live in `logs/vibe-check/*.json` and `evidence/aegis-report.json`.

### Security & Compliance

- Follow `SECURITY.md` for OWASP Top 10:2025, OWASP ASVS 5.0.0 targeting, OWASP LLM Top 10 (2025 v1.1), and MITRE ATLAS tagging.
- CI gates: Semgrep (block on policy rules), Gitleaks (`ANY=block`), OSV/pnpm audit (block on high/critical runtime deps), Trivy (vuln/misconfig/secret/license), CycloneDX SBOM, Sigstore Cosign v3 attestation.
- Evidence of each scanner runs during G5, and waivers must be recorded + time-boxed per `AGENTS.md` §27.

### MCP & Local Memory Integration

- RepoPrompt handles context building, planning, and minimal diffs.
- Context7 supplies up-to-date third-party documentation before each API touch.
- Local Memory MCP enforces memory parity between `.github/instructions/memories.instructions.md` and the Qdrant-backed service.
- Run manifests log every MCP session (server, transport, endpoint, evidence anchors).

## Adopting in CI/CD

- Wire `pnpm cortex:governance-bootstrap` into repo attach to refresh governance hashes.
- Enforce `brainwav/governance/90-infra/governance-index.json` verification in CI (already included in `agents-guard`).
- Run `pnpm readiness:check`, `pnpm lint:smart`, `pnpm test:smart`, `pnpm typecheck:smart`, and security gates before merging.
- Attach Evidence Triplet artifacts to every pull request and require the unified checklist from `brainwav/governance/20-checklists/checklists.md`.
