# Introduction to brAInwav

**brAInwav** is a governance-as-code framework for AI-assisted software development.

## What is Governance-as-Code?

Governance-as-code means:

- **Policies are code**: Stored in Markdown/JSON, versioned with your project
- **Validation is automated**: CI runs checks, humans review exceptions
- **Evidence is mandatory**: Every change generates an audit trail
- **Structure over restriction**: Guide the work, don't gate it

## Why brAInwav?

### For Solo Developers

- **Zero overhead**: Starter tier requires no external tools
- **Clear structure**: Task folders keep work organized
- **Better AI**: AI assistants work within defined bounds

### For Startups

- **Ship confidently**: Security scans in CI catch issues early
- **Compliance ready**: Evidence trails make audits painless
- **Scale smoothly**: Upgrade tiers as you grow

### For Enterprises

- **Formal compliance**: OWASP, NIST, ISO mapping built-in
- **Audit trails**: Every change has evidence
- **Platform agnostic**: Works with your existing CI/CD

## Core Philosophy

> "Guardrails, not gates"

brAInwav structures work rather than blocking it:

| Old Way | brAInwav Way |
|---------|--------------|
| Manual approval gates | Automated validation |
| Human bottleneck | Human decision-maker |
| Reactive (fix after crisis) | Proactive (structure prevents crisis) |
| One-size-fits-all | Progressive tiers |
