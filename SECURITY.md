# Security Policy

brAInwav Agentic Governance is a framework for governing AI agents, MCP integrations, and LLM-assisted development workflows. While primarily documentation and tooling, it defines patterns that influence security-critical systems. This document describes our security practices and how to report vulnerabilities.

For operational governance rules, see [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md). For LLM-specific threat controls, see [llm-threat-controls.md](brainwav/governance/00-core/llm-threat-controls.md).

## Standards & References (Jan 2026)

Pinned versions live in `brainwav/governance/90-infra/standards.versions.json` and are treated as the source of truth for this section.

If you update standards versions, update the registry first, then run `pnpm governance:sync-hashes` to refresh the governance index.

We align governance controls and verification with the following public standards/frameworks:

### OWASP Top 10 (Web/AppSec)
- Primary reference: **OWASP Top 10:2025** (final).

## Threat Model

brAInwav governance addresses threats across:
1. agent/LLM application behavior,
2. traditional web/app risks,
3. infrastructure and supply chain,
4. governance integrity.

### LLM & Agent Threats (OWASP LLM Top 10 2025)

| Threat | Minimum Mitigation | Reference |
|--------|---------------------|-----------|
| **LLM01:2025 Prompt Injection** | Strict tool schemas + allowlists; input/output validation; “no implicit tool execution”; audit trails | `llm-threat-controls.md` |
| **LLM02:2025 Sensitive Information Disclosure** | Secret redaction; least-priv data access; prevent prompt/log leakage; no secrets in context by default | AGENTS.md (§Security + logging) |
| **LLM03:2025 Supply Chain** | SBOMs; signed artifacts; pinned deps; scanner gates; model/dataset provenance | AGENTS.md §9 |
| **LLM04:2025 Data and Model Poisoning** | Dataset lineage; checksums; training/eval provenance; retrieval corpus integrity checks | `llm-threat-controls.md` + ML docs |
| **LLM05:2025 Improper Output Handling** | Treat outputs as untrusted; sanitize before rendering/executing; strict parsers; no eval | `llm-threat-controls.md` |
| **LLM06:2025 Excessive Agency** | Capability budgets; step limits; human-in-the-loop for risky tools; scoped tokens | `AGENT_CHARTER.md` |
| **LLM07:2025 System Prompt Leakage** | Prompt minimization; split secrets from prompts; prevent tool output echo; redaction | `llm-threat-controls.md` |
| **LLM08:2025 Vector and Embedding Weaknesses** | Tenant isolation; ACLs on retrieval; poisoning detection; safe chunking; query filtering | `llm-threat-controls.md` |
| **LLM09:2025 Misinformation** | Grounding policies; citations/evidence requirements; eval harness regressions block merges | Eval reports |
| **LLM10:2025 Unbounded Consumption** | Quotas, budgets, rate limits; timeouts; bounded tool loops; cost guards | `AGENT_CHARTER.md` |

### Web/Application Risks (OWASP Top 10:2025)

We use the OWASP Top 10:2025 list as a baseline taxonomy for all runtime systems:

- **A01:2025 Broken Access Control**
- **A02:2025 Security Misconfiguration**
- **A03:2025 Software Supply Chain Failures**
- **A04:2025 Cryptographic Failures**
- **A05:2025 Injection**
- **A06:2025 Insecure Design**
- **A07:2025 Authentication Failures**
- **A08:2025 Software or Data Integrity Failures**
- **A09:2025 Logging & Alerting Failures**
- **A10:2025 Mishandling of Exceptional Conditions**

### Infrastructure & Supply Chain Threats

| Threat | Minimum Mitigation | Reference |
|--------|---------------------|-----------|
| **Secrets Exposure** | Ephemeral injection (`op run` or approved secret manager); pre-commit + CI scanning | AGENTS.md §9 |
| **Dependency Vulnerabilities** | OSV + ecosystem audits; SBOM generation and scanning; patch SLAs | AGENTS.md §9 |
| **Container & IaC Misconfig** | Scan images/IaC; pinned digests; non-root; read-only FS; drop caps | AGENTS.md §9 |
| **Identity Spoofing** | OIDC/WIF; no long-lived cloud keys; scoped workload identity | AGENTS.md §9 |
| **Supply Chain Attacks** | SLSA provenance; signed releases; artifact attestations; CI hardening | checklists.md §5 |

### AI-Specific Adversary TTPs (MITRE ATLAS)

- Threat modeling and red-team work SHOULD use MITRE ATLAS as the “AI ATT&CK-style” catalog.
- Security issues and mitigations SHOULD include ATLAS technique tags when applicable (e.g., model theft, data poisoning, evasion, prompt injection).

### Governance-Specific Threats

| Threat | Mitigation |
|--------|------------|
| **Agent Charter Bypass** | CI enforcement via `charter-enforce` workflow, SHA-pinned governance index |
| **Unauthorized Governance Changes** | Hash validation in `governance-index.json`, maintainer approval required |
| **Fake Telemetry/Evidence** | Anti-patterns list (AGENTS.md), Evidence Triplet requirements |
| **Disable-the-guardrail attacks** | Any security gate disable requires maintainer waiver + time-boxed expiry |

---

## Authentication & Authorization

### OAuth 2.0 Integration (Runtime Systems)

Systems implementing brAInwav governance should follow these patterns:

- **JWT Validation**: All protected endpoints require valid JWT in `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header
- **JWKS Verification**: Tokens verified against identity provider's published key set
- **Role-Based Access Control**: User roles extracted from JWT claims

### Protected Resources (Reference)

| Resource Type | Protection Level | Required Role |
|---------------|------------------|---------------|
| Public endpoints (`/health`, `/metrics`) | None | - |
| Standard API endpoints | Authentication required | Any authenticated |
| Admin endpoints (`/admin/*`) | Admin role required | `admin` |
| MCP tool execution | Scoped permissions | Per-tool scopes |

### MCP Scopes (per AGENTS.md §13)

```
search.read    - Read access to search tools
docs.write     - Write access to documentation
memory.read    - Read from Local Memory MCP
memory.write   - Write to Local Memory MCP
memory.delete  - Delete from Local Memory MCP
```

## Data Governance & Privacy Operations

This governance pack treats data handling as a first-class security surface.

**Minimum policy (all profiles):**

- **Classification required** for data stored in logs, traces, datasets, prompts, and artifacts.
- **Retention windows declared** for logs, traces, artifacts, and datasets (default: 180 days unless overridden).
- **Erasure path documented** for DSAR/RTBF requests and incident clean-up.
- **Residency documented** when data leaves its origin region or crosses a regulated boundary.

**Evidence (release profile):**

- Retention policy location (runbook or config) referenced in the run manifest.
- Data classification tags present in Evidence Triplet metadata or task manifest.
- Post-incident data review recorded in `ops/postmortem.md` (SEV ≤ 2+).

---

## Third-Party & Vendor Governance

Any third-party service receiving source, data, prompts, logs, or artifacts must meet these requirements:

- **License validation** documented (allowed/denied license list referenced in evidence).
- **DPA/terms review** recorded when processing sensitive data.
- **Security posture** documented (SOC2/ISO/attestations, or explicit risk acceptance).
- **Exit plan** documented for critical dependencies.

**Release requirement:** vendor entries must appear in the risk register with explicit owner and review date.

---

## Access Lifecycle & Privileged Access

Access must be managed with explicit joiner/mover/leaver steps:

- **Joiner:** least-priv roles; short-lived credentials; MFA enforced.
- **Mover:** privileges re-evaluated and re-approved on role change.
- **Leaver:** access revoked within 24 hours; tokens rotated.

Privileged access is time-boxed and logged with service identity. Secrets rotate on role change and after incidents.

---

## Business Continuity & Disaster Recovery

Systems governed by this pack must define continuity expectations:

- **RTO/RPO targets** documented for critical services.
- **Backup/restore policy** documented and tested at least quarterly.
- **Recovery drills** recorded (date + outcomes) in runbook or audit logs.

Release profile requires evidence of the most recent recovery drill or a waiver with expiry.

---

## Reporting a Vulnerability

### For Critical Vulnerabilities (CVSS 7.0+)

**Do NOT open a public GitHub issue.** Instead:

1. **Use GitHub's Private Security Advisory**
   - Navigate to the Security tab → "Report a vulnerability"
   - This creates a private discussion with maintainers

2. **Email (if GitHub is unavailable)**
   - Contact: security@brainwav.io (or repository owner)
   - Include:
     - Description of the vulnerability
     - Steps to reproduce
     - Potential impact
     - Suggested fix (if any)

### For Lower Severity Issues (CVSS < 7.0)

After triage, maintainers may request a standard issue for tracking. Do **not** include exploits, credentials, or sensitive data. Expect acknowledgement within 48 hours; fixes are prioritized by severity.

## Continuous Security

### CI Security Gates (Required)

| Gate | Tool | Minimum Policy |
|------|------|----------------|
| SAST / Semgrep | Semgrep | Block on policy rules; block on High+ where configured |
| Secret Detection | Gitleaks | `ANY=block` on PRs; allowlist only for rotated/inactive/false-positive secrets |
| Dependency Audit | OSV + ecosystem audits | Block on High/Critical for runtime deps |
| Container & IaC Scan | Trivy | Block on Critical/High vulns; block on High misconfig; block on detected secrets |
| SBOM Generation | CycloneDX | Required for releases |
| Attestation & Signing | Sigstore Cosign | Required for releases; verify before publish |

### Tooling Notes & Expectations

#### Semgrep
- Semgrep rules MUST be run in CI.
- Any “waiver” must be time-boxed and recorded (see waiver process).
- Where Semgrep policies are used, rules can be set to “Block” for PR/MR gating.

#### Trivy (containers / repos / IaC)
- Trivy MUST scan:
   - container images for vulns + secrets (+ misconfig where applicable),
   - infrastructure-as-code (Dockerfiles, Kubernetes, Terraform, CloudFormation, Helm),
   - and (where used) SBOMs or installed packages.
- Use scanner selection explicitly when needed (`--scanners vuln,misconfig,secret,license`).

#### Gitleaks
- Run as:
   - pre-commit (developer workstation) AND
   - CI gate (PR and main)
- Maintain a `.gitleaks.toml` allowlist for rotated/inactive/false positives; do not “hide” live secrets.

### Automated Checks

- `pnpm security:scan` - Runs Semgrep + gitleaks + OSV audit
- `pnpm sbom:generate` - Generates CycloneDX SBOM
- `pnpm attest:sign` - Creates SLSA provenance bundle
- CI gates run on every pull request (see `checklists.md` §5)

### Governance Integrity

- `governance-index.json` contains SHA-256 hashes of all governance documents
- `charter-enforce` workflow validates hashes on every PR
- Hash updates require maintainer approval per `governance-maintainers.md`
