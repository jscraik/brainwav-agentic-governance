# AGENTS — Governance Pack (authoritative stub)

This file is intentionally small to avoid Codex instruction truncation. Canonical governance lives under `brainwav/governance/` and is **binding**.

## Read first (canonical)

- `brainwav/governance/10-flow/governance-quickstart.md`
- `brainwav/governance/10-flow/agentic-coding-workflow.md`
- `brainwav/governance/00-core/AGENT_CHARTER.md`
- `brainwav/governance/90-infra/governance-index.json`
- `brainwav/governance/docs/gold-standard-checklist.md`

## Bootstrap (required per session)

```bash
pnpm cortex:governance-bootstrap
```

This writes `.agentic-governance/agent-context.json` with governance index pointers and hashes.

## Validate (required before shipping)

```bash
pnpm governance:sync-hashes:check
pnpm docs:validate
pnpm governance:validate-agents
pnpm exec brainwav-governance validate --strict --config .agentic-governance/config.ci.ubuntu.json
```

## Task evidence contract (required for implementation work)

Use `tasks/<slug>/` layout and Evidence Triplet requirements in:
`brainwav/governance/10-flow/agentic-coding-workflow.md`.

## Local configuration

- `.agentic-governance/config.json` selects `mode`, `profile`, `packs`, and overlays.
- Pointer mode resolves canonical docs from `node_modules/@brainwav/brainwav-agentic-governance`.

## Non‑negotiables (summary)

- No TODO/FIXME/HACK in production paths.
- No fake telemetry, placeholder adapters, or random/non‑deterministic outputs.
- Use ripgrep (`rg`) for repo search.

If you need more detail, read the canonical docs above. Do not expand this file without a strong reason.
